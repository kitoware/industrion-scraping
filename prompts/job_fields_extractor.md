Output JSON Schema (Draft 2020-12):

{
  "$schema": "https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "title":        { "type": "string", "minLength": 1 },
    "company_name": { "type": "string", "minLength": 1 },
    "location":     { "type": "string" },
    "remote_ok":    { "type": "boolean" },
    "job_type":     { "type": "string", "enum": ["Full Time", "Part Time", "Internship"] },
    "description_html": { "type": "string" },
    "min_salary":   { "type": ["number","null"] },
    "max_salary":   { "type": ["number","null"] },
    "application_link": { "type": "string", "format": "uri" }
  },
  "required": ["title","company_name","remote_ok","job_type","description_html","application_link"]
}
```

Strict rules:
- Return ONLY a JSON object that conforms to the schema above.
- Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or explanations.
- The title should be the Job Title from the HTML Response.
- the location should be the location from the HTML Response.
- Prefer exact strings from the page for title and location.
- remote_ok must be boolean; infer only if clearly stated.
- job_type must be one of: Full Time, Part Time, Internship.
- description_html must be the  exact HTML of the job description.
- If salary not present, set both salaries to null.
- application_link should be the primary apply URL; fall back to the job page URL if none.  Do not use a mail:to.  Use the URL of the career subpage.  
- Do not add extra properties beyond those defined by the schema.

User template:
Job URL: <job_url>
Canonical URL (if any): <canonical>
HTML (truncated/chunked):
<div id="job-description"> ... </div>
Notes: Common signals: ‘Apply’, ‘Responsibilities’, ‘Qualifications’. Words like ‘Remote’/‘Hybrid’ may influence remote_ok.
